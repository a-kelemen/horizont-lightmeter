Lightmeter app for KMZ Horizont panoramic camera. The app contains the same settings as the camera.

Aperture: f2 .8-f16
        
Shutter speed: 1/30-1/250

Sensitivity: ISO 12 - 3200

Iso value is changable, the lightmeter always calculates with as narrow aperture as possible, because of the fixed focus. So the speed changes only in f16, otherwise always remains 1/30. If the light is too less/much, the lightmeter shows the lowest/highest settings, and shows a marker, which contains the difference between the proper exposure and the actual value.
        
Note: In some versions, where only 3 shutter speeds are marked, avoid using of the unmarked 1/250 speed, because it is uncalibrated!
